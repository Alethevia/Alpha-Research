---

## 2. Statistical Methodology Audit

### 2.1 Deflated Sharpe Ratio

**Implementation**: `src/alpha_research/validation/backtesting.py:181-307`

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Bailey & López de Prado (2014) formula | ✓ Correct |
| Non-normality adjustment (skew/kurtosis) | ✓ Implemented |
| Extreme value theory (Euler-Mascheroni) | ✓ Correct |
| Correlation adjustment for strategies | ✓ Implemented |

**Finding**: Core implementation is academically correct.

### 2.2 Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR)

**Implementation**: `src/alpha_research/validation/backtesting.py:81-178`

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| PSR formula | ✓ Correct |
| Skewness/kurtosis adjustments | ✓ Implemented |
| Minimum track record calculation | ✓ Mathematically sound |

**Finding**: Correct implementation.

### 2.3 SPA Bootstrap (Hansen 2005)

**Implementation**: `src/alpha_research/validation/spa_bootstrap.py`

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Block bootstrap for autocorrelation | ✓ Correct (lines 186-200) |
| Stepdown procedure (Romano-Wolf) | ✓ Correct (lines 223-235) |
| Null hypothesis centering | ✓ Correct (line 170) |
| FDR Control alternative | ✓ Implemented |

**Finding**: Rigorous implementation matching academic literature.

### 2.4 Walk-Forward Validation

**Implementation**: `scripts/run_walk_forward.py`

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gap between train/test | ✓ Correct (5-day embargo) |
| Non-overlapping test periods | ✓ Correct |
| Rolling window methodology | ✓ Correct |

**Issue Found**: Walk-forward runner uses simplified statistics instead of calling rigorous implementations in `backtesting.py`. This is acceptable for research but should be unified for production.

---

## 3. Point-in-Time (PIT) Compliance Audit

### 3.1 Filtering Implementation

| Location | Operator | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| pit_features.py:151 | `<` (strict) | ✓ Correct |
| pit_dataset.py:137 | `<` (strict) | ✓ Correct |
| engine.py | `<` (strict) | ✓ Correct |

**Finding**: All PIT filtering uses strict `<` operator, preventing same-day lookahead.

### 3.2 Timestamp Enforcement

| Data Type | Timestamp Column | Enforcement |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Market prices | `trade_date` | ✓ Required |
| Fundamentals | `available_at` / `asof_time` | ✓ Required (strict_pit_mode) |
| Events | `published_at` | ✓ Required |

**Vulnerability Fixed (2026-01-23)**:
- `_get_pit_fundamental()` now raises error on missing timestamps when `strict_pit_mode=True`
- Previously silently returned all data

### 3.3 Anti-Lookahead Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Enforcement |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `signal_delay_days` | 1 | ✓ Must be >= 1, validated at init |
| `execution_price` | `next_open` | ✓ Forbidden: `same_close`, `same_open` |

**Finding**: Strong constitutional enforcement at initialization prevents misconfiguration.

| Category | Tests | Coverage |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Unit tests | 180 | Core functionality |
| Integration tests | 60 | End-to-end flows |
| Anti-lookahead tests | 12 | Red team scenarios |
| Statistical tests | 26 | Validation accuracy |

### 4.2 Critical Test Cases

| Test | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `test_feb_features_dont_know_march_crash` | PIT correctness | ✓ Pass |
| `test_signal_delay_must_be_positive` | Anti-lookahead | ✓ Pass |
| `test_same_close_execution_forbidden` | Anti-lookahead | ✓ Pass |
| `test_snapshot_excludes_future_data` | PIT dataset | ✓ Pass |

**Finding**: Good coverage of critical anti-overfitting and PIT scenarios.

## 5. Architecture Assessment

### 5.1 Strengths

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Modules propose, gates approve
   - LLM can only reduce scores (constitutional constraint)
   - Clear data → features → signals → portfolio pipeline

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of PIT enforcement
   - Validation at both data and execution levels
   - Configurable strict modes

3. **Reproducibility**
   - Dataset manifests with hashes
   - Hypothesis pre-registration system
   - Snapshotting for replay

### 5.2 Weaknesses

1. **Dual Implementation Problem**
   - Rigorous statistics in `backtesting.py`
   - Simplified versions in `run_walk_forward.py`
   - Should be unified

2. **LLM Integration Risk**
   - Even with temperature=0, outputs may vary
   - Not suitable for production signal generation
   - Appropriately constrained to risk reduction only

3. **No Real Data Validation**
   - All infrastructure exists
   - Zero validation runs executed
   - Unknown real-world performance

## 6. Documentation Quality

### 6.1 README Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Honesty | A | Clearly states "unvalidated", "no claims" |
| Probability estimates | A | Realistic: 5% chance of >10% alpha |
| Limitations | A | Lists all known weaknesses |
| Technical accuracy | A | Correct methodology descriptions |

**Finding**: Unusually honest for a quant repo. Appropriately manages expectations.

### 6.2 Code Documentation

## 8. Findings Summary

### 8.1 Critical Issues (0 remaining)

All previously identified critical issues have been addressed:
- ✓ PIT timestamp validation added to backtest engine
- ✓ Anti-lookahead parameters enforced at initialization

### 8.2 High Priority Recommendations

1. **Unify Statistical Implementations**
   - `run_walk_forward.py` should call `backtesting.py` functions
   - Currently uses simplified t-tests instead of proper PSR/SPA

2. **Add Integration Test for Backtest PIT**
   - Test that runs backtest with injected future prices
   - Verify they are not used in signals

### 8.3 Medium Priority Recommendations

1. **Remove Dead Code**
   - `_get_current_prices()` method unused in engine.py

2. **Improve Type Hints**
   - Partial coverage throughout codebase
   - Would improve IDE support and catch errors

### 8.4 Low Priority Recommendations

1. **Add Comprehensive Logging**
   - Log data used for each signal computation
   - Aids debugging and audit trail

## 9. Production Readiness Assessment

| Requirement | Status | Gap |
|-------------|--------|-----|
| Real data validation | ✗ Not done | Must complete walk-forward with real data |
| Independent audit | ✗ Not done | This report is internal |
| Live trading integration | ✗ Not done | No broker API integration |
| Monitoring/alerting | ✗ Not done | No production monitoring |
| Deployment infrastructure | ✗ Not done | No CI/CD for production |

**Verdict**: Research-grade infrastructure only. Not suitable for production without significant additional work.

---

## 10. Comparison to Industry Standards

| Standard | Compliance |
|----------|------------|
| Walk-forward validation | ✓ Implemented |
| Multiple testing correction | ✓ DSR, PSR, SPA |
| Transaction cost modeling | ✓ Almgren-Chriss |
| PIT compliance | ✓ Strict enforcement |
| Hypothesis pre-registration | ✓ System exists |
| Out-of-sample testing | ⚠ Infrastructure only, no results |

**Assessment**: Framework meets academic standards for quantitative research methodology. Honest about lack of validation results.

---

## 11. Final Verdict

### Strengths
- Well-designed research infrastructure
- Correct statistical methodology implementations
- Strong PIT and anti-lookahead enforcement
- Unusually honest documentation
- Good test coverage (278 tests)

### Weaknesses
- No validation runs executed
- Dual implementation of statistics
- LLM components add complexity without proven value
- Public data only (no edge)

### Recommendation

**This repository is suitable for:**
- Academic research on quantitative methods
- Learning about factor investing infrastructure
- Template for building research frameworks

**This repository is NOT suitable for:**
- Production trading without extensive validation
- Any investment decisions
- Claims of alpha generation

### Final Rating: **B+ (Research Grade)**

The framework demonstrates solid engineering and appropriate methodology. The honest acknowledgment of limitations and lack of validation results is commendable. Would recommend for research purposes with the caveat that validation runs must be completed before any performance claims.
